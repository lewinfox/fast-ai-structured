# Useful R things

At the time of writing the intention is to duplicate the functonality of the 
[`fastai.structured`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/old/fastai/structured.py)
functions. These are very handy for working with structured data.

Done:
* `fix_missing`
* `one_hot_encode` (not in original)
* `numericalise`
* `scale_vars` (although not all functionality is there)

To do:
* `train_cats`
* `apply_cats`
* `proc_df` (depends on the others)
* Add tests
